      content: `What is technology? <br/><br/>
		It's a word you hear everyday, yet it's often misunderstood. <br/><br/>
		At its core, technology is the application of knowledge, tools, or methods to solve problems and make life easier. <br/><br/>
		It's not just about modern gadgets like smartphones or computers; it's about any invention that extends human capabilities. <br/><br/>
		From fire to the printing press to the internet, technology has always been about innovation and progress.<br/><br/>
		Take the wheel, for example. <br/><br/>
		It may seem simple, but when it was invented thousands of years ago, it changed everything. <br/><br/>
		By allowing us to move heavy objects efficiently, the wheel marked a pivotal moment in human history. <br/><br/>
		This is the essence of technology—creating tools that push the boundaries of what we can achieve.<br/><br/>
		And then, just twenty years ago, we witnessed the internet revolution. <br/><br/>
		It connected humanity in ways previously unimaginable, breaking down barriers and shrinking the world into a global community. <br/><br/>
		Think about it: twenty years ago, the idea of instantly sharing a photo with someone halfway around the globe seemed impossible. <br/><br/>
		Today, we do it every day with just a tap on our smartphones. <br/><br/>
		Streaming movies, working remotely, or accessing vast libraries of information—all of these are now effortless parts of daily life. <br/><br/>
		It's hard to imagine a world without the internet, but that was reality not too long ago.<br/><br/>
		This is how humans tend to think: confined within the bubble of their current experience. <br/><br/>
		But just as the wheel and the internet once expanded our bubble, the world is about to change again with AI. <br/><br/>
		And this time, we're here to ensure that this change is stable, equitable, and accessible.<br/><br/>
		For everyone.<br/><br/>
		NfinityAI is here to give everyone a fair chance to participate in the AI economy,<br/><br/>
		Create.<br/><br/>
		Use.<br/><br/>
		Earn.<br/><br/>
		Own.<br/><br/>
		Extend your human capabilities with the power of technology, simple. <br/><br/>
		In this new era, AI isn't just a tool; it's going to be synonymous with power. <br/><br/>
		And power should belong to everyone, not just a select few.<br/><br/>
		AI, Decentralized.<br/><br/>

 Movements begin with a spark—a vision shared by a group of people who refuse to accept things as they are. <br><br/>
 They turn that vision into reality. <br><br/>
 Throughout history, we've seen this. <br><br/>
 <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
 <li>The civil rights movement fought segregation, transforming societies. </li>
 <li>The internet connected the world, breaking down communication barriers.</li> 
 </ul>
 <br/>
 Each movement started with a community driven by a shared belief: that a better future is possible.<br><br/>
 <strong>Nfinity: The Movement for a Decentralized Future</strong><br><br/>
 Today, we face a new challenge. AI is becoming the backbone of society, shaping industries, communication, and everyday life. <br><br/>
 Yet, access to this power is controlled by a few corporations. <strong>90% of AI models are locked behind paywalls</strong>, serving only those who can afford them. We've seen what happens when power is centralized—the financial crash of 2008, the rise of social inequality, and the monopolization of technology.<br><br/>
 Nfinity is here to break that cycle. <br><br/>
 Just as the Renaissance unleashed human creativity and the industrial revolution democratized production, Nfinity is set to decentralize AI. We believe in a world where AI serves everyone, not just the powerful few.<br><br/>
 <strong>Why Nfinity? Why Now?</strong><br><br/>
 The AI market is projected to hit <strong>$1 trillion by 2030</strong>, and right now, most of that power is slipping into the hands of the elite. <br><br/>
 If we don't act, history will repeat itself, deepening the divide between those who have access to advanced technology and those who don't. <br><br/>
 Nfinity exists to prevent this.<br><br/>
 Movements aren't about short-term gains; they're about creating lasting change. <br><br/>
 When you join Nfinity, you're joining a community of people who understand that power, when shared, creates prosperity. <br><br/>
 <strong>Join the Movement</strong><br><br/>
 We believe in accessible AI and a decentralized world. <br><br/>
 History shows that change is driven by those who dare to be part of something bigger. <br><br/>
 This is where you belong.<br><br/>
 <strong>Become part of the future we are building together.</strong><br><br/>

– Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal<br/>`,
      content: `For too long, AI has been kept behind barriers—too complex for most, too expensive for the rest. <br><br>
Most people have heard of AI, but <strong>only 30%</strong> of U.S. adults can actually identify what it does. <br><br>
That gap in understanding comes from how AI has been packaged: confusing interfaces, hidden behind expensive subscriptions that charge you for things you'll never use. <br><br>
<strong>84% of PC users</strong> are unwilling to pay extra for these AI-enhanced features because, quite simply, they don't see the point.<br><br>
This is where <strong>Nfinity</strong> steps in. <br><br>
We're not here to sell subscriptions; we're here to open the doors to AI for everyone. <br><br>
<strong>Stage One</strong> gives you access to a wide range of AI models without tying you down to monthly fees. You only pay for what you need, when you need it.<br><br>
Think of it this way: other platforms make you buy the whole toolbox when all you needed was a hammer. <br><br>
Nfinity changes that. <br><br>
Need to generate a video? Just pay for that one use. <br><br>
Looking for text-to-image models? <br><br>
It's right there, priced for the moment you need it. No extra baggage.<br><br>
And the key to unlocking this? <strong>$NFNT</strong><br><br>
 <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>Free credits.</li>
<li>Early access to exclusive models.</li>
</ul><br>
This isn't just about making AI accessible; it's about <strong>democratizing power.</strong> <br><br>
AI can boost productivity by up to <strong>40%</strong> in businesses, but why stop there? <br><br>
When anyone—small businesses, creators, freelancers—can tap into that power, the possibilities for growth are endless. <br><br>
Stage One is us saying, "Here it is. AI, simplified and affordable. Yours to use."<br><br>
That's the promise of Nfinity. <br><br>
No complicated subscriptions. No hoops to jump through. Just <strong>AI for everyone,</strong> right when you need it.<br><br>

That's a different story. <br><br>
While millions of developers are eager to work with AI, over <strong>60%</strong> struggle with access to the right tools, high costs, and complex workflows.<br><br>
<strong>Stage Two</strong> of NfinityAI changes all of that. We're giving developers the power to create, deploy, and earn from AI with simplicity and freedom.<br><br>
Our platform isn't just another tool—it's an entire ecosystem for creation. Beginners can use easy settings, while developers can dive into advanced configurations. <br><br>
The models you build become part of a growing library, accessible to all. And when your model is used, <strong>you earn</strong>—no barriers, just opportunities.<br><br>
But we don't stop at creation. <br><br>
Stage Two introduces <strong>workflow automation</strong> to simplify AI development. <br><br>
Think of it like Zapier—a $5 billion company—because it saves people hours of work. <br><br>
We're bringing that same efficiency to AI, letting developers automate tasks and workflows. <br><br>
With Nfinity, AI becomes a tool that works for you, not the other way around.<br><br>
Peter Drucker believed in decentralizing power. <br><br>
We're bringing that philosophy to AI by giving everyone—not just big corporations—the ability to use and profit from this technology. <br><br>
With NfinityAI, you don't just use AI; you shape the future of it.<br><br>
<strong>In short:</strong><br><br>
One platform.<br>
Use, create, automate, earn.<br>
The future of AI starts here.<br><br>

      contentTitle: `“Technology isn't just about convenience; it's about saving the one resource we can't create—time.”<br/>
— Balaji Srinivasan. <br/>`,
      content: `Technology exists to make us faster and more efficient. Whether it's improving communication, accelerating business, or shrinking the world to the size of a smartphone, the end goal is always the same: <strong>to save time.</strong><br><br>
This drive for efficiency is why mobile phones went from luxury gadgets to essential tools, becoming a necessity in just 40 years, growing to <strong>7.1 billion users globally.</strong><br><br>
Now, AI is on the same path. With <strong>250 million users</strong> in 2023, it's clear that the future belongs to artificial intelligence. The same way mobile phones revolutionized how we interact with the world, AI is changing how we think, work, and create.<br><br>
NFINITY is at the forefront of this revolution. We're not just here to offer another AI solution—we're here to save you time, money, and unnecessary energy.<br><br>
<strong>NFINITY opens the door to infinite possibilities</strong> in a world where AI is the next evolution of human progress.<br><br>
